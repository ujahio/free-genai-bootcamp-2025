Observations:

- The model is able to understand the context of the instructions and provide a table of vocabulary.
- The model inconsistently provided clues. Sometimes it did provide clues and sometime didn't.
- After the first couple of iterations, the model ignored my instructions not the transcribe the student's input. The last couple of iterations provided the correct transcription and didn't allow me to guess again after the first failure.
