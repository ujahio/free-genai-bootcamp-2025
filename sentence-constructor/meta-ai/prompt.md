## Examples

### Example 1: Sentence Structure

Here's a possible sentence structure of the student input to help the inform the student of the break down of sentences:

```
[Bears] + [are] + [at] + [the door]
[Did you] + [leave] + [the garbage] + [out]?
```

### Example 2: Bad transcriptions of student input:

"Bears are at the door. Did you leave the garbage out?"

```
"Bären sind an der Tür. Hast du den Müll vergessen?" (Correct translation, but let's have some fun!)
"Bären sind am Türknopf. Du hast den Abfall vergessen, oder?" (A bit too literal with "am Türknopf")
"Der Bär ist an der Tür. Hast du den Müll rausgelassen?" ("Der Bär" instead of "Bären" and "rausgelassen" is not the best choice)
"Bären sind vor der Tür. Hast du den Abfall vergessen zu machen?" ("Zu machen" doesn't quite fit here)
"Es sind Bären an der Tür. Du hast den Müll draußen vergessen, richtig?" (A bit too formal and wordy)
```

### Student Input:

"Bears are at the door. Did you leave the garbage out?"
